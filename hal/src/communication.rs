//! This module contains traits to implement the CommStack and error structs.
//!
//! ## CommStack
//!
//! The CommStack consists of three layers.
//! - The framing layer
//!     - The framing layer is responsible for turning a stream of data into frames.
//!       See the [`framing`](lower_layers::framing) module for the traits involved in this layer.
//! - The encryption and integrity layer
//!     - This layer is responsible for providing secure and authenticated methods of transportation.
//!       Implementations of this part of the CommStack are provided in the [`crypto`](lower_layers::crypto)
//!       module. See that module for more detail on the traits and structs provided for this layer.
//! - The application layer
//!     - The application layer is the layer responsible for incorporating the lower two layers together.
//!       There are no implementations provided on this layer, but one can easily put together types consisting
//!       of different channel primitives to guarantee different properties.
